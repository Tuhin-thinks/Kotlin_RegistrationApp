# Kotlin_RegistrationApp
An Equivalent hello world app.

*It has just 2 windows.*


    - On first window, you have to enter a name.
    - This takes you to the second window with a bottom of the screen pop-up showing an welcome message.

**I made it just to get familiar with kotlin baics.**

*Project designed on Android studio.*
